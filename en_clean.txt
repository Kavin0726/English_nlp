scene one
alices home 

lewis carroll is discovered playing chess goldenhaired
alice in a little blue dress a black kitten in her arms stands watching
him


alice

thats a funny game uncle what did you do then

carroll

a red pawn took a white pawn this way you see alice the chessboard is
divided into sixtyfour squares red and white and the white army tries
to win and the red army tries to win its like a battle

alice
with soldiers

carroll

yes here are the kings and queens they are fighting for thats the red
queen and heres the white queen


alice

how funny they look


carroll

see the crowns on their heads and look at their big feet


alice

its a foot apiece thats what it is do they hump along like this


carroll

here youre spoiling the game i must keep them all in their right
squares


alice

i want to be a queen


carroll

here you are he points to a small white pawn here you are in your
little stiff skirt


alice

how do you do alice


carroll

and now you are going to move here


alice

let me move myself


carroll

when you have traveled all along the board this way and havent been taken
by the enemy you may be a queen


alice

why do people always play with kings and queens mother has them in her
playing cards too look

alice goes to the mantel and takes a pack of playing cards from the
ledge

heres the king of hearts and heres his wife shes the queen of
heartsisnt she crosslooking wants to bite ones head off

carroll moves a pawn

youre playing against yourself arent you


carroll

thats one way of keeping in practice alice i have friends in the
university who want to beat me


alice

but if you play against yourself i should think youd want to cheat


carroll

does a nice little girl like you cheat when she plays against herself


alice

oh i never do id scold myself hard i always pretend im two people
too its lots of fun isnt it sometimes when im all alone i walk up to
the looking glass and talk to the other alice shes so silly that alice
she cant do anything by herself she just mocks me all the time when i
laugh she laughs when i point my finger at her she points her finger at
me and when i stick my tongue out at her she sticks her tongue out at me
kitty has a twin too havent you darling

alice goes to the mirror to show kitty her twin


carroll

ill have to write a book some day about alicealice in wonderland
child of the pure unclouded brow and dreaming eyes of wonder or alice
through the looking glass


alice

dont you wish sometimes you could go into lookingglass house see

alice stands on an armchair and looks into the mirror

theres the room you can see through the glass its just the same as our
livingroom here only the things go the other way i can see all of
itall but the bit just behind the fireplace oh i do wish i could see
that bit i want so much to know if theyve a fire there you never can
tell you know unless our fire smokes then smoke comes up in that room
toobut that may be just to make it look as if they had a firejust to
pretend they had the books are something like our books only the words
go the wrong way wont there ever be any way of our getting through
uncle


carroll

do you think kitty would find lookingglass milk digestible


alice

it doesnt sound awful good does it but i might leave her at home shes
been into an awful lot of mischief today she found sisters knitting and
chased the ball all over the garden where sister was playing croquet with
the neighbors and i ran and ran after the naughty little thing until i
was all out of breath and so tired i am tired

she yawns and makes herself comfortable in the armchair


carroll

replaces the playing cards on the mantel and consults his watch

take a nap yes you have time before tea


alice

half asleep

were going to have mock turtle soup for supper i heard mamma tell the
cook not to pepper it too much


carroll

what a funny little rabbit it is nibbling all the time

he leans gently over the back of her chair and seeing that she is
going to sleep puts out the lamp light and leaves the room a red glow
from the fireplace illumines alice

dream music a bluish light reveals the red chess queen and the white
chess queen in the mirror


red queen

points to alice and says in a mysterious voice

there she is lets call her over


white queen

do you think shell come


red queen

ill call softly alice


white queen

hist alice


red queen

alice


white queen

hushif she wakes and catches us


both queens

alice come through into lookingglass house

their hands beckon her


alice

rises and talks sleepily the queens disappear alice climbs from the
arm of the chair to the back of another and so on up to the mantel ledge
where she picks her way daintily between the vases

idontknowhowicangetthrough ive triedbeforebut the
glass was hardand i was afraid of cuttingmy fingers

she feels the glass and is amazed to find it like gauze

why its soft like gauze its turning into a sort of mist why its
easy to get through whywhyim going through

she disappears


scene two

is scene one reversed the portieres are black and red squares like a
chessboard a soft radiance follows the characters mysteriously as the
curtain rises alice comes through the looking glass steps down looks
about in wonderment and goes to see if there is a fire the red queen
rises out of the grate and faces her haughtily


alice

why youre the red queen


red queen

of course i am where do you come from and where are you going look up
speak nicely and dont twiddle your fingers


alice

i only wanted to see what the looking glass was like perhaps ive lost my
way


red queen

i dont know what you mean by your way all the ways about here belong to
me curtsey while youre thinking what to say it saves time


alice

ill try it when i go home the next time im a little late for dinner


red queen

its time for you to answer now open your mouth a little wider when you
speak and always say your majesty i suppose you dont want to lose
your name


alice

no indeed


red queen

and yet i dont know only think how convenient it would be if you could
manage to go home without it for instance if the governess wanted to
call you to your lessons she would call out come here and there she
would have to leave off because there wouldnt be any name for her to
call and of course you wouldnt have to go you know


alice

that would never do im sure the governess would never think of excusing
me from lessons for that if she couldnt remember my name shed call me
miss as the servants do


red queen

well if she said miss and didnt say anything more of course youd
miss your lessons i dare say you cant even read this book


alice

its all in some language i dont know why its a lookingglass book of
course and if i hold it up to a glass the words will all go the right
way again

  jabberwocky

  twas brillig and the slithy toves
    did gyre and gimble in the wabe
  all mimsy were the borogoves
    and the mome raths outgrabe

it seems very pretty but its rather hard to understand somehow it
seems to fill my head with ideasonly i dont exactly know what they are


red queen

i daresay you dont know your geography either look at the map

she takes a right angle course to the portieres and points to them with
her sceptre


alice

its marked out just like a big chessboard i wouldnt mind being a pawn
though of course i should like to be a red queen best


red queen

thats easily managed when you get to the eighth square youll be a
queen its a huge game of chess thats being playedall over the world
come on weve got to run faster dont try to talk


alice

i cant


red queen

faster faster


alice

are we nearly there


red queen

nearly there why we passed it ten minutes ago faster you may rest a
little now


alice

why i do believe were in the same place everythings just as it was


illustration


red queen

of course it is what would you have it


alice

well in our country youd generally get to somewhere elseif you ran
very fast for a long time as weve been doing


red queen

a slow sort of country now here you see it takes all the running you
can do to keep in the same place if you want to get somewhere else you
must run at least twice as fast as that


alice

id rather not try please im quite content to stay hereonly i am so
hot and thirsty


red queen

i know what youd like

she takes a little box out of her pocket

have a biscuit

alice not liking to refuse curtseys as she takes the biscuit and
chokes


red queen

while youre refreshing yourself ill just take the measurements

she takes a ribbon out of her pocket and measures the map with it

at the end of two yards i shall give you your directionshave another
biscuit


alice

no thank you ones quite enough


red queen

thirst quenched i hope at the end of three yards i shall repeat
themfor fear of your forgetting them at the end of four i shall say
goodbye and at the end of five i shall go that square belongs to
humpty dumpty and that square to the gryphon and mock turtle and that
square to the queen of hearts but you make no remark


alice

ii didnt know i had to make onejust then


red queen

you should have said its extremely kind of you to tell me all this
however well suppose it said four goodbye five

red queen vanishes in a gust of wind behind the portieres rabbit
music white rabbit comes out of the fireplace and walks about the room
hurriedly he wears a checked coat carries white kid gloves in one hand
a fan in the other and takes out his watch to look at it anxiously


white rabbit

oh the duchess the duchess oh wont she be savage if ive kept her
waiting


alice

ive never seen a rabbit with a waistcoat and a watch and a waistcoat
pocket if you please sir


white rabbit

oh

he drops fan and gloves in fright and dashes out by way of the portieres
in a gust of wind alice picks up the fan and playfully puts on the
gloves the portieres flap in the breeze and a shawl flies in


alice

catches the shawl and looks about for the owner then meets the white
queen

im very glad i happened to be in the way


white queen

runs in wildly both arms stretched out wide as if she were flying and
cries in a helpless frightened way

breadandbutter breadandbutter


alice

am i addressing the white queen


white queen

well yes if you call that adressing it isnt my notion of the thing
at all


alice

if your majesty will only tell me the right way to begin ill do it as
well as i can


white queen

but i dont want it done at all ive been adressing myself for the last
two hours


alice

every single things crooked and youre all over pins may i put your
shawl straight for you


white queen

i dont know whats the matter with it its out of temper ive pinned it
here and ive pinned it there but theres no pleasing it


alice

it cant go straight you know if you pin it all on one side and dear
me what a state your hair is in


white queen

the brush has got entangled in it and i lost the comb yesterday


alice

takes out the brush and arranges the queens hair

you look better now but really you should have a ladys maid


white queen

im sure ill take you with pleasure two pence a week and jam every other
day


alice

who cannot help laughing

i dont want you to hire meand i dont care for jam


white queen

its very good jam


alice

well i dont want any today at any rate


white queen

you couldnt have it if you did want it the rule is jam tomorrow and
jam yesterdaybut never jam today


alice

it must come sometimes to jam today


white queen

no it cant its jam every other day today isnt any other day you
know


alice

i dont understand you its dreadfully confusing


white queen

thats the effect of living backwards it always makes one a little giddy
at first


alice

living backwards i never heard of such a thing


white queen

but theres one great advantage in itthat ones memory works both ways


alice

im sure mine only works one way i cant remember things before they
happen


white queen

its a poor sort of memory that only works backwards


alice

what sort of things do you remember best


white queen

oh things that happened the week after next for instance now

she sticks a large piece of plaster on her finger

theres the kings messengerhes in prison being punished and the trial
doesnt even begin till next wednesday and of course the crime comes last
of all


alice

suppose he never commits the crime


white queen

binding the plaster with ribbon

that would be all the better wouldnt it


alice

of course it would be all the better but it wouldnt be all the better
his being punished


white queen

youre wrong there at any rate were you ever punished


alice

only for faults


white queen

and you were all the better for it i know


alice

yes but then i had done the things i was punished for that makes all
the difference


white queen

but if you hadnt done them that would have been better still better and
better and better


alice

theres a mistake somewhere


white queen

screams like an engine whistle and shakes her hand

oh oh oh my fingers bleeding oh oh oh


alice

what is the matter have you pricked your finger


white queen

i havent pricked it yetbut i soon shalloh oh oh


alice

when do you expect to do it


white queen

when i fasten my shawl again the brooch will come undone directly oh
oh

brooch flies open and she clutches it wildly


alice

take care youre holding it all crooked


white queen

pricks her finger and smiles

that accounts for the bleeding you see now you understand the way things
happen here


alice

but why dont you scream now


illustration


white queen

why ive done all the screaming already what would be the good of having
it all over again oh its time to run if you want to stay in the same
place come on


alice

no no not so fast im getting dizzy


white queen

faster faster


alice

everythings black before my eyes

there is music and the sound of rushing wind and in the darkness the
white queen cries faster faster alice gasps i cantplease stop
and the queen replies then you cant stay in the same place ill have
to drop you behind fasterfaster goodbye


scene three

when the curtain rises one sees nothing but odd black lanterns with
orange lights hanging presumably from the sky the scene lights up
slowly revealing alice seated on two large cushions she has been dropped
behind by the white queen and is dazed to find herself in a strange hall
with many peculiar doors and knobs too high to reach


alice

oh my head where am i oh dear oh dear

she staggers up and to her amazement finds herself smaller than the
table

ive never been smaller than any table before ive always been able to
reach the knobs what a curious feeling oh im shrinking its the
fanthe gloves

she throws them away feels her head and measures herself against table
and doors

oh saved in time but i nevernever


white rabbit

oh my fan and gloves where are my


alice

oh mr rabbitplease help me outi want to go homei want to go home


white rabbit

oh the duchess oh my fur and whiskers shell get me executed as sure
as ferrets are ferrets oh you have them


alice

im sorryyou dropped them you know


white rabbit

picks up fan and gloves and patters off

shell chop off your head


alice

if you please sirwhere am iwont you pleasetell me how to get
outi want to get out


white rabbit

looking at his watch

oh my ears and whiskers how late its getting

a trap door gives way and rabbit disappears alice dashes after only in
time to have the trap door bang in her face


alice

amazed

its a rabbitholeim small enough to fit it too if i shrink any more
it might end in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i
would be like then what does the flame of a candle look like after the
candle is blown out ive never seen such a thing


humpty dumpty

sits on the wall

dont stand chattering to yourself like that but tell me your name and
your business


alice

my name is alice but


humpty dumpty

its a stupid name enough what does it mean


alice

must a name mean something


humpty dumpty

of course it must my name means the shape i amand a good handsome
shape it is too with a name like yours you might be any shape almost


alice

youre humpty dumpty just like an egg


humpty dumpty

its very provoking to be called an eggvery


alice

i said you looked like an egg sir and some eggs are very pretty you
know


humpty dumpty

some people have no more sense than a baby


alice

why do you sit here all alone


humpty dumpty

why because theres nobody with me did you think i didnt know the
answer to that ask another


alice

dont you think youd be safer down on the ground that walls so very
narrow


humpty dumpty

what tremendously easy riddles you ask of course i dont think so take a
good look at me im one that has spoken to a king i am to show you im
not proud you may shake hands with me

he leans forward to offer alice his hand but she is too small to reach
it

however this conversation is going on a little too fast lets go back to
the last remark but one


alice

im afraid i cant remember it


humpty dumpty

in that case we start fresh and its my turn to choose a subject


alice

you talk about it just as if it were a game


humpty dumpty

so heres a question for you how old did you say you were


alice

seven years and six months


humpty dumpty

wrong you never said a word about it now if youd asked my advice id
have said leave off at sevenbut


alice

i never ask advice about growing


humpty dumpty

too proud


alice

what a beautiful belt youve got on at least a beautiful cravat i
should have saidno a belt i meani beg your pardon if only i knew
which was neck and which was waist


humpty dumpty

it is amostprovokingthing when a person doesnt know a cravat
from a belt


alice

i know its very ignorant of me


humpty dumpty

its a cravat child and a beautiful one as you say theres glory for
you


alice

i dont know what you mean by glory


humpty dumpty

when i use a word it means just what i choose it to meanneither more
nor less


alice

the question is whether you can make words mean different things


humpty dumpty

the question is which is to be masterthats all impenetrability
thats what i say


alice

would you tell me please what that means


humpty dumpty

i meant by impenetrability that weve had enough of that subject and it
would be just as well if youd mention what you mean to do next as i
suppose you dont mean to stop here all the rest of your life


alice

thats a great deal to make one word mean


humpty dumpty

when i make a word do a lot of work like that i always pay it extra


alice

oh


humpty dumpty

ah you should see em come round me of a saturday night for to get their
wages you know thats allgoodbye


alice

goodbye till we meet again


humpty dumpty

i shouldnt know you again if we did meet youre so exactly like other
people


alice

the face is what one goes by generally


humpty dumpty

thats just what i complain of your face is the same as everybody
hasthe two eyessonose in the middle mouth under its always the
same now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose for
instanceor the mouth at the topthat would be some help


alice

it wouldnt look nice


humpty dumpty

wait till youve tried goodbye

he disappears as he came


alice

oh i forgot to ask him how to

she tries to open the doors they are all locked she begins to weep
she walks weeping to a high glass table and sits down on its lower ledge
she sits on a big golden key and picks it up in surprise she tries it on
all the doors but it does not fit she weeps and weepsand wonderland
grows dark to her in her despair in the darkness she cries oh im
slipping oh oh its a lake oh my tears im floating a mysterious
light shows a drink me sign around a bottle on the top of the table
alice floats up to it panting and holding on to the edge of the table
takes up the bottle


alice

it isnt marked poison

she sips at it

this is good tastes like cherry tart custard pineapple roast turkey
toffy and hot buttered toastall together oh oh im letting out like a
telescope

a mysterious light shows her lengthening out

music

but the lake is rising too oh oh its deep im drowning help help
im drowning im drowning in my tears


gryphon

hjckrrh hjckrrh

the gryphon a huge green creature with big glittering wings appears
where humpty dumpty had been and reaches glittering claws over to grab and
save alice


scene four

is symbolic of a wet and rocky shore in a weird green light the mock
turtle is weeping dismally


gryphon

hjckrrh hjckrrh hjckrrh


mock turtle

answers with his weeping


gryphon

drags alice in

drop your tears into the sea with his


alice

he sobs as if he had a bone in his throat he sighs as if his heart would
break what is his sorrow


mock turtle

oh gryphon its terrible


gryphon

its all his fancy that mock turtle hasnt got no sorrow this here young
lady she wants for to know your history she do


mock turtle

ill tell it her sit down both of you and dont speak a word till ive
finished


alice

i dont see how you can ever finish if you dont begin


mock turtle

once i was a real turtle

a long silence is broken only by the exclamations hjckrrh of the
gryphon and the heavy sobbing of the mock turtle


mock turtle

when we were little we went to school in the sea the master was an old
turtlewe used to call him tortoise


alice

why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one


mock turtle

we called him tortoise because he taught us really you are very dull


gryphon

you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question
drive on old fellow dont be all day about it


mock turtle

yes we went to school in the sea tho you maynt believe it


alice

i never said i didnt


mock turtle

you did


gryphon

hold your tongue


mock turtle

we had the best of educationsin fact we went to school every day


alice

ive been to a day school too you neednt be so proud as all that


mock turtle

with extras


alice

yes we learned french and music


mock turtle

and washing


alice

certainly not


illustration


mock turtle

ah then yours wasnt a really good school now at ours they had at the
end of the bill french music and washingextra


alice

you couldnt have wanted it much living at the bottom of the sea


mock turtle

i couldnt afford to learn it i only took the regular course


alice

what was that


mock turtle

reeling and writhing of course to begin with and then the different
branches of arithmeticambition distraction uglification and derision


alice

i never heard of uglification what is it


gryphon

never heard of uglifying you know what to beautify is i suppose


alice

yes it meanstomakeanythingprettier


gryphon

well then if you dont know what to uglify is you are a simpleton


alice

what else had you to learn


mock turtle

well there was mystery mystery ancient and modern with seaography
then drawlingthe drawlingmaster was an old conger eel that used to
come once a week what he taught us was drawling stretching and
fainting in coils


alice

what was that like


mock turtle

well i cant show it you myself im too stiff and the gryphon never
learned it


gryphon

hadnt time i went to the classical master though he was an old crab
he was


mock turtle

i never went to him he taught laughing and grief they used to say


gryphon

so he did so he did


alice

and how many hours a day did you do lessons


mock turtle

ten hours the first day nine the next and so on


alice

what a curious plan


gryphon

thats the reason theyre called lessons because they lessen from day to
day


alice

then the eleventh day must have been a holiday


mock turtle

of course it was


alice

and how did you manage on the twelfth


gryphon

thats enough about lessons tell her something about the games now

mock turtle sighs deeply draws back of one flapper across his eyes he
looks at alice and tries to speak but sobs choke his voice


gryphon

punching him in the back

same as if he had a bone in his throat


mock turtle

with tears running down his cheeks

you may not have lived much under the sea


alice

i havent


mock turtle

and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster


alice

i once tastedno never


mock turtle

so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is


alice

no indeed what sort of a dance is it


gryphon

why you first form into a line along the seashore


mock turtle

two lines seals turtles salmon and so on then when youve cleared
all the jellyfish out of the way


gryphon

that generally takes some time


mock turtle

you advance twice


gryphon

each with a lobster as a partner


mock turtle

of course advance twice set to partners


gryphon

change lobsters and retire in same order


mock turtle

then you know you throw the


gryphon

the lobsters


mock turtle

as far out to sea as you can


gryphon

swim after them


mock turtle

turn a somersault in the sea


gryphon

change lobsters again


mock turtle

back to land again andthats all the first figure


alice

it must be a very pretty dance


mock turtle

would you like to see a little of it


alice

very much indeed


mock turtle

come lets try the first figure we can do it without lobsters you know
which shall sing


gryphon

oh you sing ive forgotten the words

creatures solemnly dance round and round alice treading on her toes
waving forepaws to mark time while mock turtle sings

  first verse

  will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail
  theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail
  see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance
  they are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance
  will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance
  will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance

  second verse

  you can really have no notion how delightful it will be
  when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea
  but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look askance
  said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance
  would not could not would not could not would not join the dance
  would not could not would not could not could not join the dance

the creatures dance against alice pushing her back and forth between
them she protests and finally escapes they bump against each other


alice

thank you its a very interesting dance to watch and i do so like that
curious song about the whiting


mock turtle

oh as to the whiting theyyouve seen them of course


alice

yes ive often seen them at din

checks herself hastily


mock turtle

i dont know where din may be but if youve seen them so often of course
you know what theyre like


alice

i believe so they have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over
crumbs


mock turtle

youre wrong about the crumbs crumbs would all wash off in the sea but
they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is

mock turtle yawns and shuts his eyes

tell her about the reason and all that


gryphon

the reason is that they would go with the lobsters to the dance so
they got thrown out to sea so they had to fall a long way so they got
their tails fast in their mouths so they couldnt get them out again
thats all


alice

thank you its very interesting i never knew so much about a whiting
before


gryphon

i can tell you more than that if you like do you know why its called a
whiting


alice

i never thought about it why


gryphon

it does the boots and shoes


alice

does the boots and shoes


gryphon

why what are your shoes done with i mean what makes them so shiny


alice

theyre done with blacking i believe


gryphon

boots and shoes under the sea are done with whiting now you know


alice

and what are they made of


gryphon

soles and eels of course any shrimp could have told you that


alice

if id been the whiting id have said to the porpoise keep back
please we dont want you with us


mock turtle

they were obliged to have him with them no wise fish would go anywhere
without a porpoise


alice

wouldnt it really


mock turtle

of course not why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a
journey i should say with what porpoise


alice

dont you mean purpose


mock turtle

i mean what i say


illustration


gryphon

shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille or would you like
the mock turtle to sing you a song


alice

oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind


gryphon

um no accounting for tastes sing her turtle soup will you old
fellow


mock turtle

sighs deeply and sometimes choked with sobs sings

  beautiful soup so rich and green
  waiting in a hot tureen
  who for such dainties would not stoop
  soup of the evening beautiful soup
  soup of the evening beautiful soup
  beauootiful sooop
  beauootiful soooop
  soooop of the eeevening
  beautiful beautiful soup


white rabbit

enters stretching out a red and white checked sash with which he
separates alice from the creatures

check


mock turtle

they wont let her stay in our square


white rabbit

the queen is coming this way


gryphon

the mock turtle and gryphon grab alice and fly into the air


curtain

the curtain rises to reveal small silhouettes of the gryphon mock
turtle and alice in an orangecolored moon far away in the sky down
below the white rabbit is shouting to them youll be safe in the march
hares garden

curtain




act ii


scene

the march hares garden showing part of the duchess house on a small
platform there is a tea table set with many cups continuing into wings
to give impression of limitless length the march hare hatter and
dormouse are crowded at one end alice sits on the ground where she has
been dropped from the sky finding herself not bruised she rises and
approaches the table


march hare and hatter

no room no room


alice

theres plenty of room

she sits in a large armchair at one end of the table

i dont know who you are


march hare

i am the march hare thats the hatter and this is the dormouse have
some wine


alice

i dont see any wine


march hare

there isnt any


alice

then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it


march hare

it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited


alice

i didnt know it was your table its laid for a great many more than
three


hatter

your hair wants cutting


alice

you should learn not to make personal remarks its very rude


hatter

why is a raven like a writingdesk


alice

come we shall have some fun now im glad youve begun asking riddlesi
believe i can guess that


march hare

so you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it


illustration hatter your hair wants cutting


alice

exactly so


march hare

then you should say what you mean


alice

i do at leastat least i mean what i saythats the same thing you
know


hatter

not the same thing a bit why you might just as well say that i see what
i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see


march hare

you might just as well say that i like what i get is the same thing as
i get what i like


dormouse

you might just as well say that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing
as i sleep when i breathe


hatter

it is the same thing with you

takes out his watch looks at it uneasily shakes it holds it to his
ear

what day of the month is it


alice

the fourth


hatter

two days wrong i told you butter wouldnt suit the works


march hare

it was the best butter


hatter

yes but some crumbs must have got in as well you shouldnt have put it
in with the breadknife


march hare

takes the watch looks at it gloomily dips it into his cup of tea and
looks at it again but doesnt know what else to say

it was the best butter you know


alice

what a funny watch it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what
oclock it is


hatter

why should it does your watch tell you what year it is


alice

of course not but thats because it stays the same year for such a long
time together


hatter

which is just the case with mine


alice

i dont quite understand you what you said had no sort of meaning in it
and yet it was certainly english


hatter

pouring some hot tea on the dormouses nose

the dormouse is asleep again


dormouse

of course of course just what i was going to remark myself


hatter

have you guessed the riddle yet


alice

no i give it up whats the answer


hatter

i havent the slightest idea


march hare

nor i


alice

i think you might do something better with the time than wasting it in
asking riddles that have no answers


hatter

if you knew time as well as i do you wouldnt talk about wasting it
its him


alice

i dont know what you mean


hatter

of course you dont i dare say you never even spoke to time


alice

perhaps not but i know i have to beat time when i learn music


hatter

ah that accounts for it he wont stand beating now if you only kept on
good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock for
instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin
lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the
clock in a twinkling half past one time for dinner


march hare

i only wish it was


alice

that would be grand certainly but theni shouldnt be hungry for it
you know


hatter

not at first perhaps but you could keep it to half past one as long as
you liked


alice

is that the way you manage


hatter

not i we quarreled last marchjust before he went mad you know it
was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing

  twinkle twinkle little bat
  how i wonder what youre at

you know the song perhaps


alice

ive heard something like it


dormouse

twinkle twinkle twinkle


hatter

well id hardly finished the first verse when the queen bawled out hes
murdering the time off with his head


alice

how dreadfully savage


hatter

and ever since that he wont do a thing i ask its always six oclock
now


alice

is that the reason so many tea things are put out here


hatter

yes thats it its always tea time and weve no time to wash the things
between whiles


alice

then you keep moving round i suppose


hatter

exactly so as the things get used up


alice

but when you come to the beginning again


march hare

suppose we change the subject i vote the young lady tells us a story


alice

im afraid i dont know one


march hare and hatter

then the dormouse shall wake up dormouse

they pinch him on both sides at once


dormouse

opens his eyes slowly and says in a hoarse feeble voice

i wasnt asleep i heard every word you fellows were saying


march hare

tell us a story


alice

yes please do


hatter

and be quick about it or youll be asleep again before its done


dormouse

once upon a time there were three little sisters and their names were
elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well


alice

what did they live on


illustration


dormouse

they lived on treacle


alice

they couldnt have done that you know theyd have been ill


dormouse

so they were very ill


alice

but why did they live at the bottom of a well


march hare

take some more tea


alice

ive had nothing yet so i cant take more


hatter

you mean you cant take less its very easy to take more than
nothing


alice

nobody asked your opinion


hatter

whos making personal remarks now


alice

helps herself to tea and bread and butter

why did they live at the bottom of a well


dormouse

takes a minute or two to think

it was a treaclewell


alice

theres no such thing


hatter and march hare

sh sh


dormouse

if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourself


alice

very humbly

no please go on i wont interrupt you again i dare say there may be
one


dormouse

one indeed and so these three little sistersthey were learning to
draw you know


alice

what did they draw


dormouse

treacle


hatter

i want a clean cup lets all move one place on

hatter moves on dormouse takes his place march hare takes dormouses
place and alice unwillingly takes march hares place


alice

im worse off than i was before youve upset the milk jug into your
plate


march hare

it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited


alice

where did they draw the treacle from


hatter

you can draw water out of a water well so i should think you could draw
treacle out of a treacle welleh stupid


alice

but they were in the well


dormouse

of course they werewell in they were learning to draw and they drew
all manner of thingseverything that begins with an m


alice

why with an m


illustration


march hare

why not

alice is silent and confused hatter pinches dormouse to wake him up


dormouse

wakes with a little shriek and continues

that begins with an m such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and
muchnessyou know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you ever
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness


hatter

did you


alice

really now you ask me i dont think


hatter

then you shouldnt talk


march hare

no


alice

rises and walks away

you are very rude its the stupidest tea party i ever was at in all my
life

white rabbit enters carrying a huge envelope with a seal and crown on
it


march hare and hatter

no room no room

rabbit pays no attention to them but goes to the house and raps loudly
a footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and
powdered hair opens the door


white rabbit

for the duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet


frog

from the queen an invitation for the duchess to play croquet

white rabbit bows and goes out


march hare and hatter

to white rabbit

no room no room no room

the frog disappears into the house but leaves the door open there is a
terrible din and many sauce pans fly out


march hare

shes at it again


hatter

its perfectly disgusting


march hare

lets move on

the platform moves off with table chairs march hare hatter and
dormouse meanwhile the frog has come out again and is sitting near the
closed door staring stupidly at the sky alice goes to the door timidly
and knocks


frog

theres no sort of use in knocking and that for two reasons first
because im on the same side of the door as you are secondly because
theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you


alice

please then how am i to get in


frog

there might be some sense in your knocking if we had the door between us
for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you
out you know


alice

how am i to get in


frog

i shall sit here till tomorrow

the door opens and a large plate skims out straight at the frogs
head it grazes his nose and breaks into pieces

frog acts as if nothing had happened

or next day maybe


alice

how am i to get in


frog

are you to get in at all thats the first question you know


alice

its really dreadful the way all you creatures argue its enough to drive
one crazy


frog

i shall sit here on and off for days and days


alice

but what am i to do


frog

anything you like

he begins to whistle


alice

wheres the servant whose business it is to answer the door


frog

which door


alice

this door of course


illustration frog i shall sit here till tomorrow


the frog looks at the door and rubs his thumb on it to see if the
paint will come off

illustration


frog

to answer the door whats it been asking for


alice

i dont know what you mean


frog

i speaks english doesnt i or are you deaf what did it ask you


alice

nothing ive been knocking at it


frog

shouldnt do thatshouldnt do that vexes it you know

he kicks the door

you let it alone and itll let you alone you know


alice

oh theres no use talking to you

she starts to open the door just as the duchess comes out carrying a pig
in babys clothes she sneezesfrog sneezes and alice sneezes


duchess

if everybody minded her own business

she sneezes


alice

its pepper


duchess

of course my cook puts it in the soup


alice

theres certainly too much pepper in the soup


duchess

sneeze then and get rid of it

duchess begins to sing to the baby giving it a violent shake at the end
of every line of the lullaby

  speak roughly to your little boy
    and beat him when he sneezes

frog and alice sneeze

  he only does it to annoy
    because he knows it teases

duchess sneezes frog sneezes alice sneezes

  i speak severely to my boy
    i beat him when he sneezes

frog sneezes alice sneezes

  for he can thoroughly enjoy
    the pepper when he pleases

duchess sneezes frog sneezes alice sneezes duchess gasps and gives a
tremendous sneeze


alice

oh dear

she jumps aside as kettles and pots come flying out of the door the
duchess pays no attention

what a cook to have

she calls inside

oh please mind what youre doing

another pan comes out and almost hits the baby

oh there goes his precious nose


duchess

if everybody minded her own business the world would go round a deal
faster than it does


alice

which would not be an advantage just think what work it would make with
the day and night you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn round
on its axis


duchess

talking of axes chop off her head

the head of a grinning cheshire cat appears in a tree above a wall


alice

oh whats that


duchess

cat of course


alice

why does it grin like that


duchess

its a cheshire cat and thats why to baby pig


illustration duchess i speak severely to my boy i beat him when he
sneezes


alice

i didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didnt know
that cats could grin


duchess

they all can and most of em do


alice

i dont know of any that do


duchess

you dont know much and thats a fact here you may nurse it a bit if
you like

flings the baby at alice

i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen

she goes into the house


alice

if i dont take this child away with me theyre sure to kill it in a day
or two cheshire puss would you tell me please which way i ought to walk
from here


cat

that depends a good deal on where you want to get to


alice

i dont much care where


cat

then it doesnt matter which way you walk


alice

so long as i get somewhere


cat

oh youre sure to do that if you only walk long enough


alice

please will you tell me what sort of people live about here

alice

but i dont want to go among mad people


cat

oh you cant help that were all mad here im mad hes mad hes
dreaming now and what do you think hes dreaming about


alice

goes to the frog to scrutinize his face

nobody could guess that


cat

why about you and if he left off dreaming about you where do you
suppose youd be


alice

where i am now of course

cat

its pleased now i growl when im pleased and wag my tail when im
angry therefore im mad


alice

frog

rises with dignity whistles and disappears into the house a kettle
comes bounding out alice puts pig down and it crawls off


cat

appearing again

bythebye what became of the baby


alice

it turned into a pig

frog comes out of the house with hedgehogs and flamingoes


cat

reappearing

alice

i said pig and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so
suddenly you make one quite giddy


cat

all right it vanishes slowly

frog puts flamingoes down and reenters house while alice is examining
the flamingoes curiously tweedledum and tweedledee each with an arm
round the others neck sidestep in and stand looking at alice


alice

dum

contrariwise if you think were alive you ought to speak


dee

the first thing in a visit is to say how dye do and shake hands

the brothers give each other a hug then hold out the two hands that are
free to shake hands with her alice does not like shaking hands with
either of them first for fear of hurting the other ones feelings she
takes hold of both hands at once and they all dance round in a ring quite
naturally to music here we go round the mulberry bush


alice

  the moon was shining sulkily

dum

  the sea was wet as wet could be


dee

  o oysters come and walk with us
    the walrus did beseech


dum

looks at dee

  a pleasant walk a pleasant talk
    along the briny beach


dee

looks at dum

  the eldest oyster winked his eye
    and shook his heavy head


dum

looks at dee

  meaning to say he did not choose
    to leave the oyster bed


dee

  but four young oysters hurried up
    and yet another four


dum

  and thick and fast they came at last
    and more and more and more


dee

  the walrus and the carpenter
    walked on a mile or so


dum

  and then they rested on a rock
    conveniently low


dee

  and all the little oysters stood
    and waited in a row


dum

  a loaf of bread the walrus said
    is what we chiefly need


dee

  now if youre ready oysters dear
    we can begin to feed


dum

  but not on us the oysters cried
    turning a little blue


dee

  the night is fine the walrus said
    do you admire the view


dum

  the carpenter said nothing but
    cut us another slice
  i wish you were not quite so deaf
    ive had to ask you twice


dee

  it seems a shame the walrus said
    to play them such a trick
  after weve brought them out so far
    and made them trot so quick


dum

  o oysters said the carpenter
    youve had a pleasant run


dee

  shall we be trotting home again


dum

  but answer came there none


dee

  and this was scarcely odd because


dum

  theyd eaten every


dee

interrupts in a passion pointing to a white rattle on the ground

do you see that


alice

its only a rattle


dum

stamps wildly and tears his hair

i knew it was its spoilt of course my nice new rattle

to dee

you agree to have a battle

he collects sauce pans and pots


dee

picks up a sauce pan

i suppose so lets fight till dinner

they go out hand in hand


alice

hears music
i wonder what is going to happen next
she backs down stage respectfully as the king and queen of hearts enter
followed by the knave of hearts carrying the kings crown on a crimson
velvet cushion and the white rabbit and others when they come opposite
to alice they stop and look at her
